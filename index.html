									<p>Currently I am a Computer Science student studying at

										This is my portfolio website which I use to show off any projects that I have created.
									But also use to share anything I have found interesting during my studies and everyday life.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Journey towards Coding</h2>
									<p>My journey for coding started as a result of having a need to prove to myself that I was not a faliure.
										This was due to the fact the last thing my Headteacher telling me that I should just go into work instead of trying to get into University.
										<br>
										The sheer idea that a person who's main job was to help students with their education, had told me that I should stop trying ignited my desire to prove
										everyone wrong and after completing a foundation year in Computing achieving highest in the course.
										<br> 
										I decided to pursue Msci Computer Science as I felt as if for the first time I found something that I not only did well academically but also enjoyed.

									<h2 class="major">Finite State Automata</h2>
									<p>For my first ever coding project I decided to make a Finite-state machine.
										 Which I coded with Python which helped me to develop an understanding for how computers will behave when simulating sequential logic.   </p>

								<h2 class="major">Video Game</h2>
								<p>For my term long coursework I was assigned to create a video game using the Universities game engine with java. During this time I developed a good understanding on object orientated programming.
									<br>
									Due to having to learn how, I could accomodate my code for things such as collision between objects but also how to manipulate the engine in a way to achieve my desired results of having a challenging but fun platformer.

										<h4>Fun Fact</h4>
										<blockquote>In computer programming, there is a basic program called "Hello World", which is meant to be a way for students to easily understand how computer programs are built. There are at least 42 other languages that use a greeting very similar to "hello".</blockquote>
